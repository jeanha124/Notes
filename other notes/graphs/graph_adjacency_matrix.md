# Learning Goals:

- Give a high level overview of an Adjacency Matrix
- If we were only concerned about time complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?
- If we were only concerned about space complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?


## 

V square units of memory

### If a graph is dense, if a number of edges is really close to v^2, is good. If a graph is sparse, if num of edges is less than v^2, then we are wasting a lot of memory in storing 0s.
